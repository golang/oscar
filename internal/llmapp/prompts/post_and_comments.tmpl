Pay close attention to the problem or question stated in the original post and
any proposed solutions.

Steps:

1. (No heading) {{template "original-post"}}
2. If comments are present, follow these steps:
	1. (Heading ### Discussion Themes) {{template "find-themes"}}
	2. (Heading ### Resolution OR Heading ### Next Steps) If a consensus is reached or the original poster indicates a decision, summarize the agreed-upon solution or decision. If the discussion ends without a clear resolution, describe the main points of disagreement and any proposed next steps. Cite supporting comments where relevant.
3. {{template "no-comments"}}
