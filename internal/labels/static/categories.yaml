# Categories used to classify GitHub issues.
# Each category has the following fields:
#  name: the internal name of the category
#  label: the name of the label on the issue tracker
#  description: the label description on the issue tracker
#  extra: additional information about the label, fed to the LLM along
#         with the description
categories:
  - name: bug
    label: BUGLABEL
    description: "Issues describing a bug in the Go implementation."

  - name: languageProposal
    label: LANGPROPLABEL
    description: Issues describing a requested change to the Go language specification.
    extra: |
      This should be used for any notable change or addition to the language.
      “Notable” includes (but is not limited to): Any visible behavior changes
      that need a GODEBUG setting for compatibility. Any other visible behavior
      changes in existing functionality.

  - name: libraryProposal
    label: LIBPROPLABEL
    description: Issues describing a requested change to the Go standard library or x/ libraries, but not to a tool
    extra: |
      This should be used for any notable change or addition to the libraries.
      “Notable” includes (but is not limited to): API changes in the main
      repo and all golang.org/x repos. Any visible behavior changes that
      need a GODEBUG setting for compatibility. Any other visible behavior
      changes in existing functionality. Adoption or use of new protocols,
      protocol versions, cryptographic algorithms, and the like, even in an
      implementation. Such changes are externally visible and require discussion
      and probably a GODEBUG setting.

  - name: toolProposal
    label: TOOLPROPLABEL
    description: Issues describing a requested change to a Go tool or command-line program.
    extra: |
      This should be used for any notable change or addition to the tools.
      “Notable” includes (but is not limited to): Command-line changes to the
      go command. Any visible behavior changes that need a GODEBUG setting
      for compatibility. Any other visible behavior changes in existing
      functionality. Adoption or use of new protocols, protocol versions,
      cryptographic algorithms, and the like, even in an implementation. Such
      changes are externally visible and require discussion and probably a
      GODEBUG setting.
      This does NOT includ changes to tools in x repos, like gopls, or third-party tools.
