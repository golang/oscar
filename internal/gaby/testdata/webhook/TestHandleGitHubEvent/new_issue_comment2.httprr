I didn't want to change other code, so I've added six round-trip-failure exceptions, just to prove that at least reference links print correctly.\r\n\r\nThe new issue arises with input like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[foo][ref\\[]\r\n\r\n[ref\\[]: /uri\r\n```\r\n\r\nbeing formatted and printed as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[foo][]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nA guard clause at the top of normalizeLabel sees the bracket in `ref\\[` (from parseLinkLabel) as invalid and returns the empty string, so the link (and title) are mapped to the empty string in the links map; and my code also tries to associate the parsed link with the empty string:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rsc/markdown/blob/868a055c40ae9fc73979a95621aeaaaa016ff444/link.go#L398-L405\r\n\r\nRemoving that guard allows those six tests to pass, along with the new ref-link tests, and doesn't affect any other test.\r\n\r\nGiven that parseLinkLabel allows escaped brackets (I believe it allows all escaped chars), can a label with a bracket be used as a key?\r\n\r\nRemoving that guard clause also makes the BigTest/nested_brackets test take about 5s on my machine to run. Does that test mean anything, given that there's a 999-char limit on a label?\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to reconsider my approach my to reference links.\r\n\r\nI also saw a TODO in normalizeLabel about using the normalized label only as a key in the links map, and printing the original label.
